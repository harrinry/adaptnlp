    "# Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generation is the NLP task of generating a coherent sequence of words, usually from a language model. The current leading methods, most notably OpenAI’s GPT-2 and GPT-3, rely on feeding tokens (words or characters) into a pre-trained language model which then uses this seed data to construct a sequence of text. AdaptNLP provides simple methods to easily fine-tune these state-of-the-art models and generate text for any use case.\n",
