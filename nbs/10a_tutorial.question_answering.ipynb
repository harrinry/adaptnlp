    "Question Answering is the NLP task of producing a legible answer from being provided two text inputs: the context and the question in regards to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Question Answering models are span-based models that output a start and end index that outline the relevant \"answer\" from the context provided. With these models, we can extract answers from various questions and queries regarding any unstructured text.\n",
