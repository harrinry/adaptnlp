   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Despite quick inference functionalities such as the `pipeline` API in `transformers`, it still is not quite as flexible nor fast enough. With AdaptNLP's `Easy*` inference modules, these tend to be slightly faster than the `pipeline` interface (bare minimum the same speed), while also providing the user with simple intuitive returns to alleviate any unneeded junk that may be returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with this, with the integration of the `fastai` library the code needed to train or run inference on your models has a completely modular API through the `fastai` [Callback](https://docs.fast.ai/callbacks.core) system. Rather than needing to write your entire torch loop, if there is anything special needed for a model a Callback can be written in less than 10 lines of code to achieve your specific functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when training your model fastai is on the forefront of beign a library constantly bringing in the best practices for achiving state-of-the-art training with new research methodologies heavily tested before integration. As such, AdaptNLP fully supports training with the One-Cycle policy, and using new optimizer combinations such as the Ranger optimizer with Cosine Annealing training through simple one-line fitting functions (`fit_one_cycle` and `fit_flat_cos`)."
