<p>Summarization is the NLP task of compressing one or many documents but still retain the input's original context and meaning.</p>
<p>Below, we'll walk through how we can use AdaptNLP's <a href="/adaptnlp/summarization.html#EasySummarizer"><code>EasySummarizer</code></a> module to summarize large amounts of text with state-of-the-art models.</p>

In 1894, after his company failed to get an important </span>
<span class="s2">          contract to electrify the city of Munich, Hermann Einstein moved to Milan to work with a relative. Einstein was left at a boardinghouse in </span>
<span class="s2">          Munich and expected to finish his education. Alone, miserable, and repelled by the looming prospect of military duty when he turned 16, Einstein </span>
<span class="s2">          ran away six months later and landed on the doorstep of his surprised parents. His parents realized the enormous problems that he faced as a </span>
<span class="s2">          school dropout and draft dodger with no employable skills. His prospects did not look promising.</span>
<span class="s2">          Fortunately, Einstein could apply directly to the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule (“Swiss Federal Polytechnic School”; in 1911, </span>
<span class="s2">          following expansion in 1909 to full university status, it was renamed the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, or “Swiss Federal </span>
<span class="s2">          Institute of Technology”) in Zürich without the equivalent of a high school diploma if he passed its stiff entrance examinations. His marks </span>
<span class="s2">          showed that he excelled in mathematics and physics, but he failed at French, chemistry, and biology. Because of his exceptional math scores, </span>
<span class="s2">          he was allowed into the polytechnic on the condition that he first finish his formal schooling. He went to a special high school run by </span>
<span class="s2">          Jost Winteler in Aarau, Switzerland, and graduated in 1896. He also renounced his German citizenship at that time. (He was stateless until 1901, </span>
<span class="s2">          when he was granted Swiss citizenship.) He became lifelong friends with the Winteler family, with whom he had been boarding. (Winteler’s </span>
<span class="s2">          daughter, Marie, was Einstein’s first love; Einstein’s sister, Maja, would eventually marry Winteler’s son Paul; and his close friend Michele </span>
<span class="s2">          Besso would marry their eldest daughter, Anna.)&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
       <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The first was his encounter with a compass at age five. </span>
<span class="sd">          He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle. This would lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. </span>
<span class="sd">          The second wonder came at age 12 when he discovered a book of geometry, which he devoured, calling it his &#39;sacred little geometry </span>
<span class="sd">          book&#39;. Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and chanting religious songs on </span>
<span class="sd">          the way to school. This began to change, however, after he read science books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge </span>
<span class="sd">          to established authority left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium, Einstein often felt out of place and victimized </span>
<span class="sd">          by a Prussian-style educational system that seemed to stifle originality and creativity. One teacher even told him that he would </span>
